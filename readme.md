# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

## Project Overview
I'm working on this project to start introducing myself to data science and machine learning concepts.
In this project, we are going to segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values using the K-Means clustering technique.

## Dataset
I got the data set from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/customer-segmentation-dataset?resource=download

## Steps
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering (RFM)
- Clustering (K-Means)
- Visualizations
- Insights and Business Recommendations

## Key Findings
- (Insights will go here...)
...

## How to Run the Project
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the Jupyter notebook
